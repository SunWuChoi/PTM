# Projectile Trajectory Maker

## Description

This program generates a two-dimension, or three-dimension trajectory of a projectile based on the throwing angle, air resistance, magnus effect generated by the spin, mass, gravity, and the initial velocity. This program can generate an animation and record the time consumed to hit the ground, the highest height, distance traveled, average speed on the XY plane.
